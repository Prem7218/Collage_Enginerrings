            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of
                performing tasks that require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning,
                problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and more.</p>
            <p>AI can be broadly classified into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks like facial recognition
                or language translation, and general AI, which is intended to understand and perform any intellectual
                task that a human can do.</p>
